# DIJKSTRA ALGORITHM USING DIGITAL ELECTRONICS

I am Mehul Kumar Sahoo and I am persuing Electronics Engineering from IIT(BHU),Varanasi. This repository contains a simulation for the digital circuit for Dijkstra algorithm (maximum 8 nodes).

The "Dijkstra_Final.dsn" file contains the design file that runs on **Proteus Software**.

The graph is stored in 8 different Binary files (.bin format) where each file contains one row of modified adjacency matrix.

The overall design of the circuit looks like this :-
